# Dog Image Processor

This project fetches a random dog image from the Dog CEO API, applies a mirror effect, and processes the image in grayscale in four slices. The execution times for the mirror effect and grayscale processing are displayed on the page.

## Features

- **Fetches a Random Dog Image**: The image is fetched from the Dog CEO API (`https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`).
- **Mirror Effect**: The image is reflected horizontally on the canvas.
- **Grayscale Effect**: The image is processed into grayscale in 4 slices, each slice being processed one at a time with a 1-second delay between slices.
- **Execution Time Display**: The time taken for both the mirror effect and grayscale processing is displayed on the webpage.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) to run the project.
- The project files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) should be present in your local repository.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   ```

2. Make sure the following files are in your repo:
   - `index.html` - Contains the HTML structure.
   - `style.css` - Contains the styles for the webpage.
   - `script.js` - Contains the JavaScript logic to fetch and process the dog image.

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the project in action.

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Dog Image**: The **Fetch Dog Image** button sends a request to the Dog CEO API to get a random dog image. The image is displayed on the canvas.
2. **Mirror Effect**: After the image is loaded, a mirror effect is applied to the image.
3. **Grayscale Effect**: The image is split into four slices, and each slice is converted to grayscale one after the other.
4. **Execution Times**: The time taken for the mirror effect and grayscale processing are measured and displayed.

## Code Explanation

- **Fetching Image**:
   - The `fetchImage()` function makes an asynchronous request to the Dog CEO API to retrieve the URL of a random dog image. The image URL is used to load the image into the canvas.
   
- **Mirror Effect**:
   - The `mirrorImage()` function retrieves the image data from the canvas and swaps pixels horizontally to create a mirror effect.
   - It also measures the time taken for the mirror effect to be applied and displays it.

- **Grayscale Effect**:
   - The `processGrayscaleInSlices()` function divides the image into four horizontal slices and processes each slice into grayscale sequentially. A 1-second delay is applied between each slice.
   - The time taken for processing each slice is measured and displayed.

- **Execution Time**:
   - The performance times for the mirror effect and the grayscale processing are measured using `performance.now()` and displayed in the `time-container` div.

## Example Layout

- **Button**: A large button (`"Fetch Dog Image"`) that triggers the image fetching and processing.
- **Canvas**: The canvas displays the fetched image and processes it with effects.
- **JSON Container**: Displays the JSON data, including the image URL and API status.
- **Time Container**: Shows the time taken for both the mirror and grayscale processing effects.

## CSS Styling

The page is styled with a background image of a dog (`dog_back.jpg`), and the elements are centered on the page.

### Key CSS Styling

- **General Layout**: The page has a center-aligned layout with padding and a background image.
- **Canvas**: The canvas has a fixed width and height of 500px and a blue border.
- **Button**: The button is styled with a large font size, padding, and a smooth hover transition.
- **Containers**: The `json-container` and `time-container` have rounded corners, a light green background, and are styled for clarity.
